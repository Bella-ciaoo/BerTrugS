## How it worksüìÉ:

At first a manual insight is taken on the which attributes will be taken into consideration i.e the data from the dataset is cleaned/classified. The data is proccessed and a model is trained based on the data such that the percentage of the chance of a fradulent transaction is returned.

## Suggested Steps to prevent fraudulent transactions :
- Regular Security Upgrades in financial systems
- Block Suspicious IP addresses
- Notify User when a transaction seems sceptical
- Add biometric confirmation (eg-fingerprint) before transfer 

- Use blockchain to avoid anonymity
